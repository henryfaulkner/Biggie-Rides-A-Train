In order to reconstruct a complete train ticket, the player interacts with the train station and its inhabitants.

**Undertale**

Undertale is the story of a human appearing in a world, under false control, who moves to overturn everything (for better or for worse). Undertale features a combat system where every battle can be won with either violence or compassion. Defense-mode during combat features minigames (usually resembling an enclosed bullet-hell or a rhythm game) where the PC must avoid attacking objects to prevent damage.

## **Concept**

### **Gameplay overview**

The player controls a PC from a 2D overhead perspective. The PC will navigate their environment interacting with walls, items, and people around. Occasionally, an event will trigger switching the player to a battle sequence. They will be presented a set of options to use against an opposing force. By choosing certain options, the PC will be deemed "victorious." Key items may be gained from the open-world or from claiming victory.
