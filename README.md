## **Concept**

### **Gameplay overview**

The player controls a PC from a 2D overhead perspective. The PC will navigate their environment interacting with walls, items, and people around. Occasionally, an event will trigger switching the player to a battle sequence. They will be presented a set of options to use against an opposing force. By choosing certain options, the PC will be deemed "victorious." Key items may be gained from the open-world or from claiming victory.
