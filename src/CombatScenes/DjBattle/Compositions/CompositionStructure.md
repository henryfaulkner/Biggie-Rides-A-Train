# Composition structure file will represent the spawn pattern of the DJ's attacks

## The composition pattern will be a tokenized string, where each token represents a beat alla BPM

## Tokens:

- : [beat]
- ; [two-beats]
- ! [four-beats]
- u [up]
- r [right]
- d [down]
- l [left]
- & [end of composition]

## The implementation will be based on BPM, i.e. at 60BPM, a beat will play every second
